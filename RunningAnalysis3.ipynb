Yet, even these micro-slopes don’t slow me down compared to the Coastal Path, which has much lower positive elevation gain. The difference in speed therefore cannot be explained by elevation: despite a much higher cumulative gain on the track, i am clearly faster."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Main takeaways:\n",
    "-  For the same heart rate, pace is clearly faster on track than on beach.\n",
    "-  The difference remains for each session type.\n",
    "-  Elevation gain cannot explain the slower beach pace.\n",
    "-  The surface impact is consistent across months.\n",
    "-  The distance does not explain the pace difference.\n",
    "## ANSWER HERE\n",
    "I eventually realized that all these data points, which usually have a big impact on how a run unfolds, still can’t explain this big difference in pace that really matters to runners. It’s not the elevation, the distance, the heart effort, or even the type of workout. I thought about other factors, like temperature, but the difference remains during the same season. Then I figured it might be the course itself: on the track the route is more regular, without obstacles, the surface is uniform, and I don’t waste energy trying to stabilize my footing. In the end, these factors convinced me the most, because I can actually feel it when I run: going around in loops gives me confidence and puts me at ease."
