# Running_Analysis

This project explores my personal running sessions from March to August 2025, to answer this question:

> **Does the running surface (track vs coastal path) affect my pace for the same effort?**

### Files:
- `run2025.csv` → dataset
- `RunningAnalysis.ipynb` → code + visualizations


##  Key Insights
- For the same heart rate, pace is faster on the track than on the coastal path.  
- This difference remains across all session types.  
- Elevation gain, distance, and type of workout cannot explain the slower coastal pace.  
- The track’s uniform surface and looped route likely improve confidence, stability, and efficiency.  

### Tools:
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub
